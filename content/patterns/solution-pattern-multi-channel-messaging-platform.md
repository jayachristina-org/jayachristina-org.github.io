End-to-end AI-enabled applications and data pipelines across the hybrid cloud

<!--more-->
The solution pattern showcases an architecture that addresses the problem of communication fragmentation accross organisations. It unifying all systems as one and plugs in additional services to further enrich the platform. 



<!-- 
This solution pattern showcases an architecture which is scalable and efficient system capturing and responding to streaming data using Kafka as the streaming platform and AIML. With Event-Driven Architecture this system can connect to, and consume from a number of systems, services and data sources by responding to triggering events.

This architecture demonstrates how an Event-Driven Architecture with Red Hat AMQ Streams and OpenShift Serverless can help build an intelligent system with OpenShift Data Science platform to drive business insights and drive an event-driven workflow.
