Navigating API evolution along with changing business needs and technology landscape with a practical example

<!--more-->
This solution pattern showcases an architecture which is scalable and efficient system capturing and responding to streaming data using Kafka as the streaming platform and AIML. With Event-Driven Architecture this system can connect to, and consume from a number of systems, services and data sources by responding to triggering events.

This architecture demonstrates how an Event-Driven Architecture with Red Hat AMQ Streams and OpenShift Serverless can help build an intelligent system with OpenShift Data Science platform to drive business insights and drive an event-driven workflow.
