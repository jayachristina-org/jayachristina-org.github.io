Predict stock price trends with OpenShift AI, Machine Learning models and Data Science pipelines


<!--more-->
This solution pattern brings an architectural solution demonstrating how one can use machine learning to predict stock price. In this solution pattern, we will show the deployment of machine learning model using data science pipelines and how we can set up these pipelines.
